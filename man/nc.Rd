\title{North Carolina SIDS data}
\description{
Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) sample data for North Carolina counties,
two time periods (1974-78 and 1979-84). The details of the columns can be
found on the seealso URL, a spdep package vignette. Please note that,
though this is basically the same as \code{nc.sids} dataset in package spData,
\code{nc} only contains a subset of variables. The differences are
also discussed in the vignette mentioned.
